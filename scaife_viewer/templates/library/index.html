    The page currently lists text groups and provides filtering to quickly
    narrow down to what you want. What other information should be shown
    for each text group other than label? Should we filter or even group by
    other facets such as time period, language, geography? Should we show
    most popular works in each text group and enable immediate jumping to that
    work?
